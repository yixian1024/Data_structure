I use qsort to do this homeword.
First,I study the input.
Every round I sort the player's card and table's card.
Find minimum of the player's card and maxmum of the table's card.
If player's is bigger than table's,player discard the card,and table add a card in the end.
If player's card is no bigger than any card,sort the the number of row's card,and the number of the same row's card.
Replace the minimum row's card,and minus the point.
